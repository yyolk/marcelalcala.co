<p>First off, let me say I am sorry for the way everything happened today. It was not my intention to put you on such the defensive right before the tour. I wanted to talk with you after the tour but I had two ambassador interviews in the afternoon and was worried I would not have time. I also did not have the proper time before hand since this was just brought to my attention this morning to both think through what I wanted to say to you nor explain myself fully. That was my mistake and I hope it didn't make the situation to much worse.
Now for the meat of the issue; your attire (when I said your "dress" earlier this is what I meant, not as in actual dresses) was a concern that was brought to me by Rose. Specifically in regards to the impression that special VIP guests may or may not have (like the Chinese students and the group of art teachers you are giving a tour to tomorrow) she is concerned about how we can best present and represent SAIC. You have to remember that while admissions (and Rose as our head) is at heart here for the students to receive a quality art education, we are also the main ones responsible for the future of SAIC. We have to balance getting the best, most qualified students with maintaining the budget and making enrollment goals. While SAIC is an amazing school with a top notch reputation, we still have to work very hard making the best impression on students, their parents, art teachers, local affiliates, etc so that we can get the most talented to choose SAIC once they are accepted. The ambassador position is a huge part of that especially since you are often the first person they meet on campus. For the new ambassadors I have been interviewing, I have been telling them that while a student may or may not in the end end up being admitted to SAIC, on a tour, we need to present a unified experience for all visitors. While many of those visitors can be culturally enriched artists, many can also be more sheltered or reserved but still just as talented in their art. We need to cater to all of their needs and have mutual respect for everyone that visits. If you have heard me address the issue of "work of an adult nature" in my tour intro, this is exactly why I do that. While someone going to art school will need to experience nudity in a figure drawing class, I need give them heads up since many may not be expecting to see this since they have not been exposed to the full spectrum of the art world yet. That does not make them any less qualified or talented but its something to be mindful of respecting.
I was talking through this whole situation with my mom tonight and she reminded me of a few things that may help fully understand all sides of the situation. There are those in this culture who have even stronger beliefs about their "attire" than you have with regards to who they are as people. Specifically I am referring to nudists. My grandparents were nudists back in the day. They went to nudist colonies (really just glorified camp grounds with a bunch of old naked hippies, not all all like what most people would think) and celebrated their freedom by removing the shackles of modern society (obviously clothes). My grandfather would always say though that there is a time and a place for their beliefs. They did not go walking around downtown Park Ridge naked (suburb up on the north side of the city where Hillary Clinton is originally from). My mom also reminded me that during meals and during dancing at the camps, clothes were required due to health and sanitation issues. For dancing in particular, this was not to stifle any one's freedom, but to keep in mind a mutual respect for others in what could turn into a sensitive situation. This can be said of a tour as well. This brings me back to what I was talking about before with a mutual respect for all of those involved when in a public situation. </p>
<p>Yes, you are an art student and you are here to be yourself and embrace your individuality. Your style is tied directly into who you are as a person and I fully support that aspect and believe that is part of what makes you such an energetic and fun tour guide. I am here to do a job though and that job includes giving potential students a level playing field when it comes to touring as well as help ensure the future of the school. I have to walk a very thin line between working with the ambassadors as a team and being your boss. We have a great group of students right now and you are an integral part of that. Also though, things are different now than they were under Liz and while I enjoy talking with you all, I am still your supervisor and need to have that role respected. Just as you all have asked me to respect your roles. I have done my best to accommodate you this summer with regards to special tour notification, special projects, the amount of hours you want to work this summer and as much flexibility as I can with regards to office work. Now its time for you to do the same and meet me somewhere in between on this issue. You and I need to figure out a way to both show your personal style as well as put a professional foot forward as an ambassador.  I have no issues with you wearing skirts or dresses. I also have no issue with you having painted nails or wearing makeup (in fact you look quite elegant sometimes when you step it up a notch from everyday). Whether a dress is worn by a man or a woman though, whoever is wearing it should be mindful of how they walk, sit or move through space.  The more gracefully you carry yourself, the more respect you will command from your audience (skirt or not for that matter). So I would like you to be mindful of the way you carry yourself in your garments that you choose to wear. I would also like you to be mindful of how much of your chest hair that you show. An age old argument of female nudists is the inequality of what men can show over women. Within that stereotype, it is suitable for a man to show far more of his chest than woman wearing the same garment. If I wore the same outfit and my breasts were hanging out on a tour I would be having a much harder time than you justifying my personal style. There is a time and a place for chest hair but during a hot summer tour with a name tag stuck to it, is really not the place. Regardless of whether or not it may be appealing or humorous to some visitors, it is not necessarily sanitary (again think about how I described the nudist colony) and can be downright offensive to even culturally enriched individuals. I would also like you to make sure you are keeping up your standards when it comes to hygiene. As I mentioned above, you can be quite elegant when you step it up a notch and I think if you push your style to a higher level it will help ease some of the concerns overall with your attire. If you make these few small gestures and work with me on this it will go a long way to showing me just how professional and part of the team you can be. This is a job which requires you to work with me on any situations as they occur. If you refuse to try to find a compromise with me, while you will not be let go as an ambassador, Admissions may not assign you to certain tours we feel another guide would be better suited for. We need to make sure we can bring in the best students suited for SAIC and that is a managerial decision I may have to make to ensure the health of the college. Just as I may assign a specific ambassador a task based on their personal skills or areas of study, I may also not assign one to do something for the same reasons. This is not the best of part of my job but it is something I have to consider when doing my job to the best of my ability. If I can not assign you to all the tours you may be available for, this of course would also severely hinder the number of hours you are able to earn (since again I have been going out of my way with you to make sure you can earn the hours you need). </p>
<p>Now for what I am unhappy about; the fact that you refused to give the tour today and left. I understand you were offended and flustered and that was partially my fault for springing it on you like I did but I asked you to stay and you flat out ignored my authority as your supervisor. You left even after I told I knew Rose would not be available to meet with you today. Regardless of the situation with your attire, you need to be on hand for tours when you are scheduled and not decide to leave without my approval. Last week Siera fell off her bike and could not do the tour because she was so shaken up (ending up having a concussion). Today though, while still emotional for you, was not the same type of situation and thus it was not acceptable for you to leave. If you want to make a living as an artist you have to be able to let certain things roll off your back or put them aside until there is an appropriate time. You will have many more encounters in your life that will test who you are and some may be very difficult to turn the other cheek to in the heat of the moment (trust me I know). I have seen you act very adult and do this on several occasions over just the two short months I have been here and I expected better of you today. This is probably why I did not over think talking to you about all of this on the fly. Again though, regardless of what happened, you should have still been willing to give the tour. To be clear, since you did not tour, you will not get paid for today so please remember this when filling out your next time sheet. This will also be recorded as an unexcused tour absence and if this kind of unexcused absence continues, it may cost you your job as an ambassador. 
That all be said, I would really like you to come in tomorrow before or after your special tour so we can talk about this all in person. I have a few more personal stories to share and want to talk with you more about your side of things so we can come to a compromise. I also want to reiterate once again how valuable you are to this team and that I think we can definitely figure out how to move forward here so every one's goals are met. </p>
<p>I will be coming over to Columbus for the start of the special tour since it will be a group of teachers touring our facilities to research renovating their high school art classrooms. If I do not see you before then, see you at 10:00.
